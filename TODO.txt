BUGS (TODO)
- vision circle is not consistently shaped. why?
- leylines look choppy
- zooming always recenters the map (not good)
- starting temple should never be in water! then again, there should probably never be a starting temple

TODO, generally, and in order
- [ability to] preview lines & structures before placing
- on-hover effects for lines & structures (just names, i guess? maybe only structures for now?)
- right-clicking: building structures in empty space + structure stats & options (this is how you upgrade structures!)
- store local resource-related properties within structures at time of building -> structures actually gather LOCAL resources
- ability to upgrade structures
- actually make structures that lengthen lines
- make line-vision look a little nicer by putting circles on the enpoints
- basic sound? building, upgrading
- actual good UI in a sidebar
- hide mouse pointer when cursor is over map (show when on sidebar)
  - or make a little 4-directional arrow appear [when clicking & dragging?]
- prevent building on water
- make food a resource that depletes over time. should be pretty easy to get, though
- try adding culture effects
- saving & loading. can player have multiple saves? maybe load button = preview of map? save little graphics?
- click-and-drag to move map (left-click)
- drag-and-drop for structure building? modes? (normal clicking should be for moving the map, at least (i.e. dragging around))
- more zoom levels
- buttons for zooming in/out on the map. maybe 4x little previews (just versions of the world canvas at different scales? :))
- view culling
  - store visibility state in structures/lines; update whenever view or zoom changes
  - lines: always visible as long as both endpoints aren't off the same side of the viewport
	- structures: always visible if inside viewport (with some tolerance)
- probably limit structures' leyline bonuses. cap at 3 or something? will be very hard to balance otherwise
- game intro/info/credits, etc
- add more cultures & unlock mechanics (i.e. player only has access to some)
- lots of balancing!
- more sophisticated terrain generation
  - iron veins?
  - rivers?
- (cleanup) make type-in-table implementation pattern more consistent. each structure should just contain its structureInfo
  - it's ok to reference one table from another! probably!
- (cleanup) similarly, make color implementation patterns more consistent.
  - i forgot that setColor() can take a table {1,2,3,4}, which sure seems more efficient than {r=1, g=2, b=3, a=4}
- more/better art, esp. for different cultures
  - structures should not go from border to border
- warning for users on machines that can't handle multicanvases (i'm using 3 at once so far)
- better-looking fog?
? maybe dedupe leylines. could be hard but would decrease exploitation

cultural effects brainstorm
- inuit: good in water; bad on land
  - wait, inuit might be ancient but they aren't extinct. might be odd
- vikings: great at exploring on water; need more food?
- druids: wood stuff. cheaper wood temples? all temples draw wood lines?
- egyptians: better at gathering stuff from sand?
- ancient greek? ancient roman?
- mesopotamian/babylonian: ...something to do with rivers??
- mayan/incan/aztec
- navaho/iroquois/apache/ainu/others?
- unlockable: martian, lemurian, narnian?, elven?, ysian?
- some culture: ...
  - leylines are naturally longer
	- monuments are cheaper
	- less-strict prerequisites for temple/great temple building (maybe tradeoffs)
	- get more resources back when a structure is destroyed
	- better at finding iron
	- towers see much further
	  - or towers always treated as being at max elevation? at if they were flying?
	- consume food more slowly
	- can build on water
	  - good for Ys, maybe
	  - just shallow water, or any water?
	  - can ONLY build on water?
	- sructures can be moved?
	- structures wander randomly? or can be upgraded to wander?
	- no access to [structure type]
	  * OR all cultures have different structure-upgrade trees, with different costs and such
	- higher leyline bonus cap on structures (4?)
	- better at storing [resource type] or all resources
- someone who makes ley-circles between triplets of temples, not lines between pairs (hard! but cool and different!)
* no idea for most of these. looks like you'll have to do some research!
  - maybe start by googling "ancient civilizations"
* temples and stuff should have different graphics for different cultures! :)

original structure ideas:
temple: every pair makes a leyline. cost increases quickly. only gathers local resources when built? or when clicked?
village: slowly gathers local resources. cost increases slowly. leyline effect = slightly faster gathering
quarry: gathers stone from red areas. medium cost increase. leyline effect = faster gathering
mill: gathers wood from green areas. medium cost increase. leyline effect = faster gathering, also produces food?
farm: gathers food from blue areas. medium cost increase. leyline effect = faster gathering, also produces wood and stone?
tower: reveals terrain, slowly gathers local resources. medium cost increase. leyline effect = sees much further
monument: cost increases quickly. leyline effect = lengthens leyline! TODO actually see if this works
signpost: cost increases quickly. leyline effect = turns water under leyline into land (like a bridge)
green -> wood, red -> stone, blue -> food (water and fish)?
are people a resource, too? or just abstracted to food?

other ideas:
- different structure "blueprints" have to be discovered. just uncover the terrain & click to acquire or something
- scrying for rare/unique items: send out 5 evently spaced lines; something good is on one of those lines; can use multiples to triangulate to distant points (but not perfectly)
- large temples for uniting distant areas, i.e. regular temples' leylines have a length limit, but better ones can link farther
- elevation increases vision for any structure. mountaintops are ideal.
  - maybe looking uphill is also harder? could be a lot harder to do if tall mountains block your view or something, though...
	- maybe use terrain noise to generate and store these shapes (not just circles) separately + draw them at stencil stage
* after taking a long nature walk today...
	- upgrading basic settlements and temples -> other structures, usually more specialized
	  - temple (plain line only)-> stone temple (plain + weak stone line) -> great stone temple (strong stone line, no plain line?)
	- need special lines/structures to reveal special resources? e.g. magnetic lines reveal iron (mining = pure guesswork, otherwise)
	- different kinds of temples make different kinds of leylines (wood, stone, food, etc)
	  - "great" temples, too (aligned and unaligned), that only link with each other & have powerful effects
		- food temples should be called harvest temples ;)
  - maybe play as different ancient cultures with different bonuses? (druids = cheaper wood temples, vikings = good at sailing, etc)
- structures can only become temples if they're near other N (3?) other structures?
  - and great temples have to be on N leylines? 3?
- maybe monument is just a kind of temple?
- terraforming?? definitely a "stretch goal", but would be cool. dams make rivers, ores get depleted, forests get cut down...
- rivers? walk downhill to ocean from high elevation?
- optional buildings/constructions? villages can HAVE towers and monuments, you don't turn a village INTO a tower or a monument
  * or just don't make village a type of structure. keep them all small, like camp, and maybe house
	  - basic leyline structure could be altar or something. temples are bigger than that
- story premise: a <beast> came into your <lodge> and killed your <chiefs> while you hid nearby -> now have to survive and rebuild
  - <lodge> becomes a Ruin (â‰ˆ Temple), your starting structure. links with temples and such, provides initial resource gains
  - can maybe find other Ruins around world? would definitely need to 
	- goal of game is to kill <beast>?? need to build a <culture-specific weapon> to do it??? gather parts around world????
	- kind of changing the tone here, but it could work...
* maybe storage facilities are needed to retain resources, up to a maximum? i like this idea! stone piles, wood piles, granaries...
  - but should they have to be near facilities that fill them? i think that's not necessary...
